Class project for IT266

The project is based around killing monsters for item drops and leveling up as you kill them.

Monsters have a low chance to drop an item. You can get a maximum of 2 items per game. You can see what item you have by hitting the F1 menu. THe game makes sure you get item drops that synergize with each other, meaning your second item drop depends on what you got for your first one (first one is completely random).

You gain experience for killing monsters. As you level up it takes more experience to reach the next level. You gain stat points as you level.

STR : Increases health by 1 point per STR
POW : Increases damage by 1% per POW
DEX : Gives chance to crit for double damage, gives chance to dodge attack (aka jack of all trades hybrid stat, but inferior to the pure stats)

The help menu is completely replaced by your character information like stats, gear, experience etc.
